# Multiplication Table Generator

This Python script generates the multiplication table for a number specified by the user.

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. When prompted, enter the number for which you want the multiplication table.
3. The script will then print out the multiplication table for the chosen number, from 1 to 12.

## Example

```
What's the number for the multiplication table you want? 7

You chose the multiplication table of 7, here we go:

7 X 1 = 7
7 X 2 = 14
7 X 3 = 21
7 X 4 = 28
7 X 5 = 35
7 X 6 = 42
7 X 7 = 49
7 X 8 = 56
7 X 9 = 63
7 X 10 = 70
7 X 11 = 77
7 X 12 = 84
```

## Code Explanation

1. The script first prompts the user to input the number for which they want the multiplication table.
2. It then informs the user of their choice and prints a blank line for readability.
3. A range from 1 to 12 (inclusive) is created to use for the multiplication.
4. The script then loops through the range and prints the multiplication of the chosen number with each number in the range.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
